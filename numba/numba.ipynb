    "# Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numba** is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that translates Python functions into optimized machine code at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a Python function is decorated with Numba, it gets compiled into highly efficient machine code the first time it's called, resulting in performance improvements ranging from 2x to 100x compared to pure Python code. This is particularly powerful for numerical computations and algorithms that would otherwise be slow in standard Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits of Numba:\n",
    "- Near-C execution speeds while writing pure Python code\n",
    "- Automatic parallelization capabilities\n",
    "- Minimal code changes required - often just a decorator\n",

    "\n",
    "This option forces Numba to compile to machine code without relying on the Python `C` API. This results in higher performance code, but it requires that the types of all inputs and outputs can be inferred. If Numba cannot infer the types (for example, if you use a specific Python data type that cannot be resolved at compile time), `@jit` will fall back to the so-called `object mode`, which results in significantly slower performance. Note that `@njit` is simply an alias for `@jit(nopython=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cache`**: \n",
    "\n",
    "This option instructs Numba to save the results of function compilation into a **file-based cache**. When you use a function that has been previously compiled with Numba, it retrieves the compiled version from the cache instead of recompiling. This is especially useful in larger projects where multiple files or notebooks are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`parallel`**: \n",
    "\n",
    "This option enables Numba to compile a version of the function that will run in parallel across multiple native threads (without the Global Interpreter Lock!). Numba supports _explicit parallel loop declaration_, allowing for embarrassingly parallel computation across loop iterations. You can specify this using `numba.prange` instead of `range` in your `for` loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, be cautious: using parallel execution does not guarantee a speedup, as it involves threading and may incur overhead from scheduling tasks across processing units. If the input data is small enough, the scheduling overhead might negate any performance gains from threading."

To work with ndarrays more flexibly, Numba offers the `@guvectorize` decorator, which allows you to write universal functions (ufuncs) that can operate on an arbitrary number of elements of input arrays and return arrays of potentially differing dimensions.\n",

Instead, they function similarly to \"void\" functions: they take the result/output values as input parameters and fill them. This behavior is akin to kernels in CUDA.\n",
